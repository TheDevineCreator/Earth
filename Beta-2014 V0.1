Seeing as this project is now public, i have begun my removing any issues regarding bugs which have evolved into mythology.

Changelog:

1. Fixed the minor collision issue occouring with humans in the debug area. "Ghosts" should no longer be a problem.
2. Removed the elemental error in which everday items could be turned into gold by exesive exposure to random chemicals, should act as a temporary fix to "Alchemy".
3. I have put a temporary fix in place to stop the humans in "magic circles" actualy gaining the use of magic which sould have been limited to newspawns with the mg/3 gene.
4. Removed item "knit_rug_4_tassles=true" which was responsible for causing the flying carpet mythology due to its faulty gravitational nodes. 
5. Cut down the light supplies being chaneled to transport shaft_5 in the hope of ceasing "i saw the light" statements from humans passing through before a rollback.
6. Ceased communications between the seemingly uncontrollable "god_christianity" and people group "christians_living" to stop the never ending torrent of prayer which were acting as a Ddos attack to servrers "christianity1 & chrisitianity2".
7. Begun work on implemementing a fix to the gyroscopic effect bug. Hopefully all work will be completed before humans realise its full potential.
8. Some brief changes to the lightspeed settings in order to allow the implications of faster than light travel hopefull in the next 20000-25000 years.

Feels like good progress has been made today, stay tuned!
